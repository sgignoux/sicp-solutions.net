## Exercise 1.8

> Newton’s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if $y$ is an approximation to the cube root of $x$, then a better approximation is given by the value
> 
> $${\frac{{x/y^2}+2y}3.}$$
> 
> Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton’s method in general as an abstraction of these `square-root` and `cube-root` procedures.)

## Solution

Using the same improvement for large and small number from exercise 1.7:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (good-enough? previous-guess guess)
  (< (abs (/ (- guess previous-guess) guess)) 0.00000000001))

(define (cube-root-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess (improve guess x))
      guess
      (cube-root-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (* guess guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3))


(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-root-iter 1.0 x))
```
