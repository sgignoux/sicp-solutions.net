**Exercise 1.10**

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann’s function.

```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```scheme
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive integer values of `n`. For example, `(k n)` computes $5n^2$.

**Solution**

All the following expansion has been painstakingly made by hand.

```scheme
(A 1 10)
(A 0 (A 1 9))

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))

$f(n) = 2n$

$g(n) = 2^{n}$

$h(n) = 2^{h(n-1)}$

Using the [tracing function in DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/debugging.html#%28mod-path._racket%2Ftrace%29) would by more efficient than doing all by hand, but not as fun.
