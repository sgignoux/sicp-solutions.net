**Exercise 1.16:** Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does `fast-expt`. (Hint: Using the observation that ${(b^{n/2})^2}={(b^2)^{n/2}}$, keep, along with the exponent $n$ and the base $b$, an additional state variable $a$, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product ${ab^n}$ is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process $a$ is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of $a$ at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an _invariant quantity_ that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)
