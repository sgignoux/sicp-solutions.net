**Exercise 1.29:** Simpson’s Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson’s Rule, the integral of a function $f$ between $a$ and $b$ is approximated as

$$\frac h3(y_0+4y_1+2y_2+4y_3+2y_4+\cdots+2y\_{n-2}+{4y\_{n-1}+y_n),}$$

where ${h=(b-a)/n}$, for some even integer $n$, and $y_k={f(a+kh)}$. (Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.) Define a procedure that takes as arguments $f$, $a$, $b$, and $n$ and returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson’s Rule. Use your procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with $n$=100 and $n$=1000), and compare the results to those of the integral procedure shown above.
