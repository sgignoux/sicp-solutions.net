The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.

```
         1
       1   1
     1   2   1
   1   3   3   1
 1   4   6   4   1
       . . .
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.

**Solution:**
